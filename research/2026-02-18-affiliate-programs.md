  - Articles comparing Zapier vs Make vs n8n can link Make.com affiliate
- Continue writing Zapier content for SEO/traffic but monetize via other tools

5. Write Jasper AI review article targeting "best AI writing tool" keywords
6. For Zapier content: add Make.com affiliate links as alternative

### Affiliate Network Consolidation
